  <h2><a id="about_me">About me</a></h2>
    <p>
      I am currently a junior in <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/ce/about/index.html" target="_blank">Computer Engineering</a> that is also pursuing a 
      <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/mtde/academics/degrees/undergraduate/cybersecurity-minor/index.html" target="_blank">Cybersecurity</a> minor.
      My hobbies are playing games as well as learning to cook.
      As a programmer, I am looking forward to always learning what is new and recieving teaching under others.
      I love to produce a solution to a given problem and learn other's approach to the same problem.
      As a person, I am excited to learn about other people's cultures and seeing other people's viewpoints.

    <h3>Client Server Connection</h3>
      <p>
        In my Introduction to Computer Systems Class, I created a connection between Client
        and Server using multiple different connections like a FIFO channel and a TCP channel.
        The client could request data points from the server as well as perform file transfers
        from the server. Throughout the class, I continually worked on this client server
        project. With the introduction of threads, the program had a speedup time by using
        threading. At the end of the class, I created a TCP connection that allowed the
        client and server to be hosted on two different PC's. The TCP connection was
        created using sockets to connect to the server. For my project, I ended up hosting
        the client and server on virtual machines hosted on <a href="https://cloud.google.com/" target="_blank">Google's cloud</a> to connect them
        between one another.
      </p>
    <h3>Linux Shell</h3>
      <p>
        For this project, I recreated the Linux shell using exec functions. Commands like grep,
        ls, and echo could be used in this shell. The program used a lot of string manipulation
        to extract commands from user input. The shell also allowed for input/output redirection
        so the program could place the output of a command into a text file. For this project,
        I used pipelining to allow the output of a command to be used as the input of the next
        command. For the pipelining to work, I used a fork to create child processes that
        executed commands. At the end of the program, I used waitpid to kill zombie processes.
      </p>
    <h3>String Calculator</h3>
      <p>In this project, I created a calculator that could perform addition, subtraction,
        multiplication, and division. The calculator took in user input as strings and performed
        the calculations by going through the string one character at a time until the entire
        calculation was finished. This method allows for the calculator to perform calculations
        that would not typically be able to be performed due to integer overflow in C++.

  <h4>Areas of Interests</h4>
    <p>Cybersecurity</p>
    <p>
      I am very interested into learning Cybersecurity because I believe it is important
      that everyone's private information is protected. Currently, I am taking a minor in Cybersecurity
      and would like to be employed in the a related field.
    </p>
    <p>AI</p>
    <p>
      I want to learn how machine learning and AI work because they are interesting to me. In particular,
      <a href="https://www.tesla.com/autopilot" target="_blank"> self-driving</a> car technology is one field I would like to potentially work in.
    </p>
  <h2><a id="service">Service</a></h2>
    <p>
      As part of my <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/iap/index.html" target="_blank">scholarship</a> to the department, 
      I am looking forward to volunteering to help the department
      in the future. I would also love to give back to my community in the future after I find a
      workplace with something minor like a small mentorship on coding. In grade school, I promoted
      a charity called <a href="https://www.coolearth.org/" target="_blank">Cool Earth</a>, and I would like to continue supporting charities in the future by donating.
